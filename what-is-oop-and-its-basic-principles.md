# What is OOP and its basic principles

#### What is OOP and its basic principles?

**Answer:** OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. The four basic principles of OOP are:

* **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data and code together into a single unit, e.g., a class.
* **Inheritance**: Mechanism where one class inherits properties and behaviors from another.
* **Polymorphism**: Ability to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types).
* **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.
