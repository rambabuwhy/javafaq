# What are the benefits of using interfaces

#### What are the benefits of using interfaces in Java?

**Answer:**

* **Multiple Inheritance**: A class can implement multiple interfaces.
* **Abstraction**: Defines a contract that classes must follow, without specifying how they should be implemented.
* **Decoupling**: Allows different parts of a program to communicate with each other via a common interface.
